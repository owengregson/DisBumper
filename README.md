# DisBumper
A discord bot that automatically bumps your discord server on any bot that supports slash-command bumping.

Usage guide:

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed from https://nodejs.org/
- Put the script in a directory, open a cmd window in the directory, and use "npm i" to install dependencies.
- Then, run the script using "node bot.js"
- Then, configure your config.yml (add token, messages, channels, etc.) and run the script again
- The bot will begin bumping until either the token invalidates or you cancel the script.

Happy bumping!

PSA: My variable names are really cryptic in this script; I didn't have time to make it look neat. Most of the crazy variables and randomization are to bypass detection from Discord and the bot service you are using to bump your server.
