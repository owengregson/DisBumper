# DisBumper
A discord bot that automatically bumps your discord server on any bot that supports slash-command bumping.

Usage guide:

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed from https://nodejs.org/
- Put the script in a directory, open a cmd window in the directory, and use "npm i" to install dependencies.
- Then, run the script using "node bot.js"
- Then, configure your config.yml (add token, messages, channels, etc.) and run the script again
- The bot will begin bumping until either the token invalidates or you cancel the script.

Happy bumping!
